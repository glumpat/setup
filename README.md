# Daham

A place like home. Fully automated Antergos setup script. Install all the packages, and all the CLI tools. 

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hschne/daham/master/install.sh)"

Have a look at the [script](install.sh) for more info!

## Ideas for Improvements

- Colors, colors everywhere :rainbow:
- Hide output, instead redirect to log. Its a bit messy at the moment
- Provide infos about installation progress, with checkmarks and stuff. And the total time it took. And a summary!
